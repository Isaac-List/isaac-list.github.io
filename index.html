        Hello! My name is Isaac, and I am an undergraduate Computer Science
        student studying at <a href="https://www.luther.edu">Luther College</a>
        in the Driftless region of northeast Iowa.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am interested in working on projects which are interactive, communicate
        information in novel ways, and provide unique challenges to me as a
        programmer. I also hope to eventually contribute to free and open-source
        projects which I rely on each day to complete my tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        My other interests include language learning (both programming and natural
        languages), history, mapping, and science - both fact and fiction!
